            <p >Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we are living in. Therefore, if society is to achieve quick economic advancements
                 and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential. 
                The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques
                 and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately, and morally are all included in computer science.
                  Employers who recruit computer scientists demand competent programmers with knowledge
                 of modern techniques and tools as well as the ability to apply good engineering concepts to the development,
                 production, and maintenance of their products. Computer programming is at the core of computer science.</p>

                 <P >This makes us come in as a department.A department that is producing great IT experts through out the world.
                    This is achieved through the introduction of courses 
                    that provides the platform for further studies in the percular fields of computer science.
